Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer exclusive 
Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and, in some cases, 
the creator's heirs or assigns ("Copyright Holder") of an original work of authorship 
and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain Copyright Holders ("Original Author") of Works wish to permanently relinquish 
those rights to a Work for the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, 
cultural and scientific works that the public can reliably and without fear of later 
claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and 
redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes, 
including without limitation commercial purposes. These Copyright Holders desire to 
make those rights available to the general public in such a manner that those individuals 
can relieve themselves of the consequences of the prior copyright restrictions on these Works.

Therefore, the Copyright Holders undertake to exercise any Copyright and Related Rights 
they hold in the Work under the following terms and conditions:

1. Waiver

Copyright Holder waives the copyright and related rights in the Work to the extent 
possible under law in all territories of the world, including without limitation all 
present and future rights therein, whether now known or hereafter discovered. The copyright 
holder does not waive the rights that may not be waived under applicable law.

2. Public License Fallback

Should any portion of the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective 
under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted 
taking into account the intent and purpose of Creative Commons. Additionally, to the extent 
the Waiver is so judged Creative Commons hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, 
non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to 
exercise Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.

3. Limitations and Disclaimers

a. No trademark or patent rights held by Creative Commons are waived, abandoned, surrendered, 
   licensed or otherwise affected by this document.

b. Creative Commons offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties of any 
   kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including without 
   limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, 
   non infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present 
   or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible 
   under applicable law.

c. Creative Commons disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons that may 
   apply to the Work or any use thereof including without limitation any person's Copyright 
   and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Creative Commons disclaims responsibility for 
   obtaining any consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.

d. If any restriction can not be waived, the Work is provided royalty-free under the terms 
   of this License to each person entitled to benefit from the restrictions contained herein.

e. Nothing in this license shall be deemed to waive, abandon, surrender, license or otherwise 
   affect any claim which Creative Commons otherwise might have, whether now known or unknown, 
   in the Work.
